# Changelog

-   **0.9.2** (May 28 2021)
    -   Features:
        -   `GrandIsoExecutor`: Utilizes the node attribute matching flow available in grandisoâ‰¥2.0.0 to reduce complexity of attribute-heavy searches (#104)

    -   Features:
        -   `GrandIsoExecutor`: Adds support for the `grandiso.find_motifs_iter` generator API in grandiso v1.2.0; this reduces the runtime of queries with nonzero `limit` (#102)
-   **0.9.0** (March 23 2021)
    -   Features:
        -   `Neo4jExecutor#create_index`. This function call adds an index to the database on the node attribute specified, in order to improve query performance (#95)
        -   `dotmotif.ingest.EdgelistConverter` now supports importing from a dask or pandas dataframe edgelist in addition to files on disk (#99)
    -   Chores:
        -   Put lingering top-level tests into their own directory (#100)
-   **0.8.1**
    -   Chores:
        -   Upgraded to the latest version of Tamarind, with Neo4j v4.2 support (#93)
        -   Upgraded to the latest version of GrandIso, v1.1.0
-   **0.8.0** (January 12 2021)
    -   Features:
        -   Add `!contains` and `!in` attribute constraints to the parser. (#88)
        -   Neo4j and NeuPrintExecutors now support custom node/edge labels (#91)
    -   Bugfixes:

        -   Fix an issue introduced in 0.8.0 where !contains/!in operators failed to parse for Neo4j/NeuPrint executors. If you are installing DotMotif from pip/pypi, this issue is already fixed. (#92)
-   **0.7.0** (October 14 2020)
    -   Executors:
        -   Add new `NeuPrintExecutor` with motif-search support for neuPrint databases (#76)
        -   Add new `GrandIsoExecutor` as a Python-only drop-in replacement for `NetworkXExecutor` (#80). If you're still using `NetworkXExecutor`, you should really switch!

        -   Improve `utils.draw_motif` rendering style
        -   Improve networkx import for Neo4j databases to use better datatype inference
        -   New `dotmotif.Motif` class. This is just a naming thing; all your old `dotmotif.dotmotif` code will still work! (#84)
        -   Short motifs can now be written on a single line, with semicolons to delimit commands (#84)
    -   Bugfixes:
        -   Improve pip-installation process by including EBNF grammar definitions

        -   Moved documentation from `docs/` to [the wiki](https://github.com/aplbrain/dotmotif/wiki) for a more permanent and organized home (#81)

    -   Housekeeping:
        -   Upgrade to networkx v2.4
        -   Include `Neo4jExecutor` in default package imports
-   **0.5.0** (April 07 2020)
    -   Features:
        -   Add `Executor#count()` function call to return only a motif count rather than a complete result set.
        -   Improve speed response of automorphism detection (use internal Neo4j IDs)
        -   Add optional wait when creating a `Neo4jExecutor`
    -   Bugfixes:
        -   Fix indexing of automorphisms to better jive with Neo4j's internal result ordering.
        -   Fix issue where `NetworkXExecutor` would fail to identify all isomorphisms. This was due to a nomenclature mismatch between NetworkX and other executors. More details [here](https://github.com/aplbrain/dotmotif/issues/64).
        -   Automatically add `exists=True` condition to edges added using `dotmotif#from_nx()`.

    -   Parsers:
        -   Fix [#35](https://github.com/aplbrain/dotmotif/issues/35), wherein a `WHERE` clause was omitted from the cypher query constructed from the `Neo4jExecutor` under certain conditions
    -   Bugfixes:
        -   Fix #26 by raising an explanatory error message when graphs with integer IDs are imported.
